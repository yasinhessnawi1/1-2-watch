### Our Contributions (Novelty)

While there are many applications providing media information, our focus is on helping you follow up with your favorite media by providing timely and specific information that’s not always easy to find. For instance, finding out when the next episode of your favorite show airs can be time-consuming if the media doesn’t have a straightforward schedule.

Our application aims to make this process seamless by allowing you to search for the name of the media and immediately get the information you’re looking for. We prioritize ease of use and straightforward access to information, making the experience of tracking your favorite media more enjoyable and less complex.
